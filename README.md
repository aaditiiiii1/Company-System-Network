# Company System Network Design 
---

## üìå Project Overview

This project simulates a secure and scalable enterprise network for a trading floor support center using Cisco Packet Tracer. A hierarchical three-tier topology with VLANs, OSPF, DHCP, NAT/PAT, and security features like SSH and ACLs ensures smooth communication, redundancy, and future scalability.

## üß© Features

- **3-Tier Hierarchical Design**  
  Core, Distribution, and Access layers for scalability and efficient traffic flow.  

- **High Availability**  
  Dual ISPs, dual routers, and multilayer switches for redundancy and failover.  

- **VLAN Segmentation**  
  Separate VLANs for Sales, HR, Finance, Admin, and ICT with inter-VLAN routing.  

- **Dynamic IP Management**  
  DHCP server for automated IP assignment; static IPs for critical servers.  

- **Dynamic Routing**  
  OSPF protocol for optimized routing and fault tolerance.  

- **Security Features**  
  - SSH for secure remote administration  
  - NAT/PAT for safe internet connectivity  
  - ACLs & Port Security for controlled access

## üó∫Ô∏è Network Topology Highlights

- **Core Layer:** Two redundant routers and multilayer switches with backup links  
- **Distribution Layer:** VLAN-based departmental switches for Sales, HR, Finance, Admin, and ICT  
- **Access Layer:** End-user devices and Cisco APs for wired and wireless connectivity  
- **Servers:** DNS and HTTP servers hosted in Server VLAN (60) with static IPs  
- **DHCP Server:** Provides dynamic IP allocation for client devices
